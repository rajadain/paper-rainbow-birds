Living their lives in ignorant bliss,  
Their vision straight and narrow.  
Woken by touch of Destiny’s kiss  
And touch of Cupid’s arrow.

He was a dreamer of type and code  
Come from a land strange and far.  
She was a dancer of tribal mode,  
An artist of highest par.

Cautiously they probed for intellect  
Revealing a matching mind.  
Finding upon delving deeper that  
Their interests intertwined.

They spoke of life, love, art and beauty.  
Of train rides in the winter.  
Of movement, privilege, and duty.  
Of travel interstellar.

As they shared their triumphs and regrets,  
Commonality was found  
Amidst space cowboys and robot jets  
And adventures outward bound.

Coffee shop, a dance, a concerto —  
They met a handful of times.  
But their temperaments did not go  
Together as did their minds.

Yet through their letters and their writing  
Unique friendship had been wrought.  
For its promise and traits redeeming  
They gave it another shot.

What then followed was a blossoming  
The like they had never seen:  
From Haverford to North Liberties  
And everything in between.

At the peak of their conversation,  
When everything seemed just fine,  
Came disbalancing their equation  
Tragedy of closest kind.

Between changing jobs and homes anew  
Their rhythm was disrupted.  
The delicate thread that bound these two  
Was severed and corrupted.

He tried to pull her back, have some fun  
With musical comedy.  
It only made her angry, someone  
That she didn’t want to be.

Fixated on the idea of  
Making her happy again  
He pushed way too hard, so she pulled out  
And that was the very end.

Having hurt one whose he loved so much  
He recused himself in shame.  
Waiting weeks for cooling down and such,  
He appealed to her in vain.

After losing sleep and forty pounds  
And forgetting how to eat,  
For two thousand miles he flew around,  
Climbed more than a thousand feet.

On top of Mt. Sanitas he sat  
With a paper rainbow bird,  
And wrote to her in a letter that  
Which need be said but not heard.

A mistake which she could not forgive  
And that he could not forget.  
He, by penning this final missive,  
Broke the cycle of regret.

Now they live their separated lives  
In staging and production.  
His yogic mind wouldn’t ever drive  
Her hips of mass destruction.

Cruel fate had given them a taste of  
That which was not meant to be.  
It would indeed have been a waste of  
A Virginian Wonanee.

Though the fabric frayed and colors ran  
The mixing of these two dyes  
Left a kind of after-taste that can  
Linger without true goodbyes.

Whether the twain shall ever again  
Meet, we may not discover.  
Tragic, since she did once love him plain  
In ways he’d never loved her.

As fall nights melt into chilly dawns  
And cold December sunrise,  
The other’s misty moon sets upon  
Their own personal night skies.
